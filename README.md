# The Forbidden Island
  
  
  ## Description and Story of the Project
  
  
The game's backstory revolves around the pirate from Somalia
named Cabdi. As his name implies, he is ordered to go out
to sea and find loot to bring back to his Leader. From there, he is instructed to go
to Jasiiradda la Mamnuucay, otherwise known as the Forbidden Island. The island is located a
few miles out of the island of Seychelles in the Arabian Sea. The Leader tells Cabdi that he has sent
countless men to the island and they have never returned. It is said that there is something unbelievable
on the island that can be very profitable. The leader instructs Cabdi to take a boat
to the island and eliminate anyone that will interfere with his task. Cabdi accepts the job
without a second thought and takes to the seas to reach the island.
As for the gameplay itself, it resembles the old COD zombies structure. Waves of zombies will spawn through the blue containers, growing increasingly as time goes on. Unlike the COD zombies, where there is down-time between rounds, there is no rounds or down-time. With the increase of spawned zombies growing through time, they also become stronger and faster. To survive the horde, the player needs to earn money to buy the guns and upgrades scattered around the map.

  ## Contributing
  
  Contributions are always accepted. I put together this project in a very short amount of time for my CS 320 Gaming class in my Junior year while I was attending St. Thomas Aquinas College. There is never no room for improvement.
